Lighthouse System/Protocol:  
Each Vive base station is a lighthouse that sweeps the room with infrared light. On its upper left there is an LED array that emits a sync flash every 8.33 ms (120 Hz). It also has two rotors with lasers that rotate around the horizontal and vertical axes (with respect to the base stationâ€™s coordinate system) at 3600 rpm or 60 revolutions per second.

The rotor that rotates around the vertical axis sweeps the tracking volume in front of the base station with a vertical fan of light from left to right, and the rotor that rotates around the horizontal axis sweeps the tracking volume with a horizontal fan of light from bottom to top. These sweeps are interleaved: first the vertical laser sweeps left to right, then half a revolution or 8.33 ms later the horizontal laser sweeps bottom to top. With two base stations the order is: base station A vertical laser, base station A horizontal laser, base station B vertical laser, base station B horizontal laser. A sync flash occurs at the beginning of each 8.33 ms period to synchronize the events and the width of the sync flash pulse sets three bits of information - skip, data, and axis.

Unity:  
In Unity, we created a simple 3D scene and a box to represent our car. We attach a more detailed mesh of a car we designed in Blender to the box and a SensorTriang C# script. The script opens a serial port and reads the data sent by the PSoC. It converts the time measurements to angles, azimuth (beta) and elevation (theta), from the lighthouse.
Given three sensors that form a triangle and the beta/theta angles to each sensor, we can calculate the angles between any two sensors with respect to the origin. We can then form a system of non-linear equations for the unknown ranges or distances to each sensor. The length of sides AB, BC, and AC are known and measured beforehand on the car mast. Using the Newtonian root finding method and the Jacobian we iterate until the error is less than a certain threshold.

Results:  
The SteamVR lighthouse system is a very cheap and scalable model: the laser rotors are inexpensive and easy to assemble and in fact the main limitation of the tracking volume is the distance the sync flash can travel, but one could imagine chaining any number of these base stations together to achieve an infinitely large tracking volume. The lighthouse system can also be very fast and accurate when implemented properly, with which we struggled a great deal. But more sensors placed in optimal arrangements with minimal occlusion can achieve pinpoint accuracy and a fast dead-reckoning algorithm with periodic correction can achieve high framerates.
